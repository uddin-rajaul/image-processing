# Machine Learning Algorithms

- Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes Classifiers
- K-Nearest neighbor
- Artificial Neural Networks (belongs to subfield of deep learning)

Each algorithm uses different techniques to learn patterns from data and make predictions or discover structure in data.

1. Supervised Learning Algorithms (SVM, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) - where the model is trained on labeled data.
2. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms (K-Means, PCA) - where the model learns from data without explicit labels.
3. Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) - which reduce the number of features in data while preserving its important str.

### 1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

- **Type:** Supervised learning algorithm (classification and regression).
- **Use case:** Primarily used for classification tasks (e.g., image recognition, text classification).
- **How it works:** SVM finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes. In higher dimensions, this hyperplane can be a line, plane, or hyperplane.
- **Key feature:** Can handle both linear and non-linear classification by using kernel tricks to project data into higher dimensions.

### 2. **K-Means Clustering**

- **Type:** Unsupervised learning algorithm (clustering).
- **Use case:** Used to group similar data points into clusters (e.g., market segmentation, image compression).
- **How it works:** Divides data into **k** clusters based on distance, where each cluster is represented by a centroid. The algorithm iterates by adjusting cluster centroids to minimize the variance within each cluster.
- **Key feature:** Fast and simple, but the number of clusters (k) needs to be predefined.

### 3. **Linear Regression**

- **Type:** Supervised learning algorithm (regression).
- **Use case:** Used for predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., predicting house prices, sales forecasts).
- **How it works:** Models the relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) by fitting a straight line that minimizes the error between the predicted and actual values.
- **Key feature:** Simple to understand and interpret, but assumes a linear relationship between variables.

### 4. **Logistic Regression**

- **Type:** Supervised learning algorithm (classification).
- **Use case:** Used for binary classification tasks (e.g., spam detection, disease prediction).
- **How it works:** Similar to linear regression but applies the **sigmoid function** to the output to constrain the predictions between 0 and 1. This makes it suitable for probability-based classification.
- **Key feature:** Handles binary and multi-class classification problems effectively.

### 5. **Decision Trees**

- **Type:** Supervised learning algorithm (classification and regression).
- **Use case:** Used for tasks like classification (e.g., fraud detection, customer segmentation).
- **How it works:** Splits the data into branches based on feature values to create a tree structure. Each branch represents a decision, and the leaf nodes represent the output (class label or value).
- **Key feature:** Easy to interpret and visualize, but can overfit without pruning or regularization.

### 6. **Random Forest**

- **Type:** Supervised learning algorithm (ensemble method).
- **Use case:** Used for classification and regression tasks (e.g., credit scoring, stock market prediction).
- **How it works:** Builds multiple decision trees (a "forest") and aggregates their results for better accuracy and generalization.
- **Key feature:** Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy by averaging the results from multiple trees.

### 7. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**

- **Type:** Supervised learning algorithm (classification and regression).
- **Use case:** Used in recommendation systems, image recognition, and classification tasks.
- **How it works:** Classifies a data point based on the majority vote of its **k** nearest neighbors in the feature space.
- **Key feature:** Simple and intuitive, but can be computationally expensive for large datasets.

### 8. **Naive Bayes**

- **Type:** Supervised learning algorithm (classification).
- **Use case:** Used for text classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis.
- **How it works:** Based on Bayes' theorem, it assumes that the features are independent given the target class, which simplifies the computations.
- **Key feature:** Fast and works well for high-dimensional data like text.

### 9. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

- **Type:** Unsupervised learning algorithm (dimensionality reduction).
- **Use case:** Used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets (e.g., in image compression, data visualization).
- **How it works:** PCA identifies the principal components (i.e., directions of maximum variance) in the data and transforms the data to a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible.
- **Key feature:** Helps in reducing the complexity of data without losing much information.

### 10. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**

- **Type:** Supervised learning algorithm (ensemble method).
- **Use case:** Used in regression and classification tasks (e.g., ranking, customer churn prediction).
- **How it works:** Builds models sequentially, where each new model corrects the errors of the previous ones by minimizing the loss function.
- **Key feature:** Powerful and accurate, but can be slow to train.

# Deep Learning

- It is a type of machine learning where computers learn to do tasks by processing large amounts of data.
- Its called “Deep” because it uses layers of artificial “neurons” to make sense of complex info like recognizing faces, understanding speech
- More layer, better it can learn

![image.png](Background%20Removing%201047ab64f9e180e68633ca5c62b436f8/image%205.png)

### Common activation functions used in neural networks include:

### 2. **Sigmoid**

- **Formula:** \( f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \)
- **Range:** (0, 1)

    ![image.png](Background%20Removing%201047ab64f9e180e68633ca5c62b436f8/image%206.png)
    
- **Range:** (-1, 1)

### 6. **Swish**

- **Formula:**
    
    ![image.png](Background%20Removing%201047ab64f9e180e68633ca5c62b436f8/image%208.png)
    
- **Range:** (-∞, ∞)
- **Use case:** Developed by Google, Swish is gaining popularity as it can outperform ReLU in some tasks.

- **Range:** (-α, ∞), where α is a hyperparameter.
- **Use case:** Similar to ReLU but allows for smoother and faster convergence.
- **Pros:** Reduces the vanishing gradient problem.
- **Cons:** More complex and slower than ReLU.

### Loss Function:

- measures how well or poorly the models predictions match the actual data (ground truth).
- Goal of training model is minimize the loss function,
- adjust models parameters (weights and biases) through a process called optimization

### Optimization

**Optimization** refers to the process of adjusting the weights and biases in such a way that the model's performance improves. The aim is to minimize the loss function (the difference between the model’s predictions and the actual values).

**Gradient Descent** is one of the most common optimization algorithms used to adjust weights and biases. Here's how it works:

- **Gradient:** This refers to the direction and rate of change of the loss function. Imagine the loss function as a hill, and gradient descent is the process of finding the lowest point on that hill (the minimum loss).
- **Descent:** The algorithm calculates the gradient (slope) of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters (weights and biases). It then updates the parameters in the direction that decreases the loss. This process is repeated over many iterations until the model converges to the point where the loss is minimized.

CNN

what is CNN/ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?

- Also know as ConvNet
- **The process starts by sliding a filter designed to detect certain features over the input image**, a process known as the convolution operation (hence the name "convolutional neural network"). The result of this process is a feature map that highlights the presence of the detected features in the image.
- Specialized type of deep learning algorithm mainly designed for tasks that necessitate object recognization, including image classification, detection, and segmentation.
- Practical Scenarios: auto car, security camera systems etc..

![image.png](Background%20Removing%201047ab64f9e180e68633ca5c62b436f8/image%2010.png)

| Layer | Number of Nodes |
| --- | --- |
| Input layer | Must have one node for each component/feature of the input data |
| Hidden layers | Number of nodes is chosen (arbitrarily or empirically) by the network architect |
| Output layer | Must have one node for each of the possible output classes |

## **Key Components of a CNN**

The convolutional neural network is made of four main parts.

But how do CNNs Learn with those parts?

They help the CNNs mimic how the human brain operates to recognize patterns and features in images:

- Convolutional layers
- Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU for short)
- Pooling layers
- Fully connected layers

**Do we have to manually find these weights?**

In real life, the weights of the kernels are determined during the training process of the neural network.

![image.png](Background%20Removing%201047ab64f9e180e68633ca5c62b436f8/image%2011.png)

Another name associated with the kernel in the literature is feature detector because the weights can be fine-tuned to detect specific features in the input image.

For instance:

- Averaging neighboring pixels kernel can be used to blur the input image.
- Subtracting neighboring kernel is used to perform edge detection.

The more convolution layers the network has, the better the layer is at detecting more abstract features.

![image.png](Background%20Removing%201047ab64f9e180e68633ca5c62b436f8/image%2013.png)

## **Convolution layers**

- the main mathematical task performed is called convolution
- application of a sliding window function to a matrix of pixels representing an image
- each filter is used to recognize a specific pattern from the image, such as the curving of the digits, the edges, the whole shape of the digits, and more.
- As it moves across the photo, it creates a new grid that highlights where it found these patterns.

## Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU for short)

- ReLU activation function is applied after each convolution operation.
- helps network learn non-linear relationship, between features in the image
- helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problems.

## Pooling Layer

- pull the most significant features from the convoluted matrix.
- reduces dimensions and computation
- model is tolerant towards variations, distortions
- applying some aggregation operations, which reduce the dimension of the feature map (convoluted matrix), hence reducing the memory used while training the network
- mitigate overfitting.
- The most common aggregation functions that can be applied are:
    - Max pooling, which is the maximum value of the feature map
    - Sum pooling corresponds to the sum of all the values of the feature map
    - Average pooling is the average of all the values.

![image.png](Background%20Removing%201047ab64f9e180e68633ca5c62b436f8/image%2014.png)

## Flattening

- Flattening is like taking a 3D box of numbers (or a 2D grid, or any shape with multiple dimensions) and squishing it down into a 1D line of numbers.
- This makes it easier for the computer to understand the features when it's time to make a final decision, like deciding if an image shows a cat or a dog.

## how weight is determined

The weights for the 1D line of numbers are determined during the training process of the neural network. The network starts with random weights, then it makes predictions based on these weights. The differences between the predictions and the actual values are calculated, and the weights are adjusted slightly to make the predictions more accurate. This process is repeated many times, and the weights are adjusted each time, until the predictions are as accurate as possible. This is called learning or training the model.

### What computers “SEE”?

![image.png](Background%20Removing%201047ab64f9e180e68633ca5c62b436f8/image%2015.png)

===========================================================

**features** : (important attributes or patterns in the data)

**3x3 Kernel**: A filter that scans 3x3 sections of the image.

**Stride of 1**: The filter moves 1 pixel at a time across the image.

**Covers Every Pixel**: No pixel is skipped during the scan.

**Detailed Feature Map**: Provides a more precise output but requires more computations.

# U-NET

## Introduction

- U-Net is a convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation.
- It relies on a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path for precise localization.
- It is built upon FCN(Fully Convolutional Networks)  and modified in a way that it yields better segmentation in medical imaging.
- U-Net is trained end-to-end from few images and outperforms previous methods in segmenting neural structures.
- The network is fast, taking less than a second to segment a 512x512 image on a recent GPU.

## Architecture

- U-Net consists of a contracting path (left side) and an expansive path (right side).
- The contracting path follows the typical architecture of a convolutional network, with repeated applications of 3x3 convolutions (unpadded).
- Each contraction stage is followed by a 2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling.
- The encoder block reduces dimensionality while increasing feature complexity, essential for capturing spatial hierarchies in images.
- Skip connections play a crucial role in preserving spatial information, allowing the decoder to utilize features from the encoder effectively, improving segmentation quality.
- Transposed convolutions in the decoder not only upscale features but also introduce learnable parameters, enhancing the model’s ability to reconstruct images.
- The expansive path consists of up-convolutions (also known as transposed convolutions) that upsample the feature maps, followed by a 2x2 convolution that reduces the number of feature maps.
- Concatenation with high-resolution features from the contracting path is performed at each up-convolution step.
- The final layer is a 1x1 convolution that maps the feature maps to the desired number of classes.

box corresponds to a multi-channel feature map. The number of channels is denoted
on top of the box. The x-y-size is provided at the lower left edge of the box. White

## Data Augmentation

- Data augmentation is crucial for U-Net to perform well with few images.
- Techniques like rotation, scaling, flipping, and elastic deformations are used to increase the size of the training set.
- Data augmentation helps the network learn invariance to these deformations, allowing it to generalize better.

## Training and Inference

- U-Net is trained using a weighted loss function, where the separating background labels between touching cells obtain a large weight.
- During inference, the network can predict the segmentation of arbitrarily large images using an overlap-tile strategy.
- Missing context in the border region is extrapolated by mirroring the input image.

## Applications

- U-Net has shown strong results in segmenting neuronal structures in EM stacks and won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in transmitted light microscopy categories.
- It can be applied to various biomedical segmentation problems.

## Tips for Implementing U-Net

- Use a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to implement U-Net.
- Prepare your dataset by annotating images and splitting them into training and validation sets.
- Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the size of your training set.
- Evaluate

===========================================================

- semantic segmentation
- instance segmentation

Instance segmentation can essentially be solved in 2 steps:

1. Perform a version of object detection to draw bounding boxes around each instance of a class
2. Perform semantic segmentation on each of the bounding boxes

For background removal in images, you'd typically use semantic segmentation or instance segmentation techniques rather than R-CNN. Here are some approaches you could consider:

1. U-Net: A popular architecture for image segmentation tasks.
2. DeepLab: A state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model.
3. Mask R-CNN: An extension of Faster R-CNN that can perform instance segmentation.

### What are **Atrous (Dilated) Convolutions**?

- **Atrous (dilated) convolutions** are similar to regular convolutional filters, but with one key difference: they introduce gaps (or dilation) between the filter elements.
- **Filter (Kernel):** In a normal convolution, the filter (e.g., 3x3) moves across the image pixel by pixel, performing a dot product.
- **Dilated/Atrous Convolutions:** Instead of the filter looking at consecutive pixels, it "dilates" the filter by skipping pixels. This allows the filter to cover a larger area of the image without increasing the number of parameters.

### Why Use Atrous Convolutions?

- They help the model to **capture a larger context** or view of the image without increasing the size of the filter or reducing the spatial resolution of the image.
- This makes them useful in tasks like **semantic segmentation** and **image matting**, where you need to capture fine details (small features) and broader context (large features) at the same time.

In the context of **MODNet**, the **e-ASPP** module uses atrous convolutions to extract features at multiple scales, which is important for capturing both fine and large-scale details efficiently.

Object detection + semantic segmentation = instance Segmentation

***Seeds* allow you to create a starting point for randomly generated numbers, so that each time your code is run the same answer is generated**. The advantage of doing this in your sampling is that you or anyone else can recreate the exact same training and test sets by using the same seed.
